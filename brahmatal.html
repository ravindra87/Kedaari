                                <h4>Brief Description About the Trek</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Spanning over 28 km, the Brahmatal trek begins from the base village of Lohajung
                                    located in the Chamoli district in Garhwal Himalayas. The 6 km trek from Lohajung to
                                    the Gujreni campsite runs through dense forests of Conifer, Cedar, Oak and Fir. The
                                    Gujreni campsite is at the heart of a beautiful clearing surrounded by Oak and
                                    Rhododendrons with panoramic views of snow-capped ranges.

                                    <br>

                                    The peak view from the route is captivating, from east to west you can see the High
                                    Himalayan ranges. On the right towards eastward direction you can see Mrigthuni,
                                    Devtoli and Maikoti peak of Kumaon. Straight to your north Trisul massif and
                                    gigantic Nanda Ghunti are breathtaking. Bethartoli Himal and Nandaghunti. On the
                                    left westward side we can see the massive Chaukhamba, Neelkanth, Kamet, Hathi and
                                    Ghoda peaks. This is just the opposite ridge of the famous Roopkund trek and offers
                                    a Birds-eye view of the route including Ali Bugyal, Bedni Bugyal, Roopkund and
                                    Junargali including far poised famous Ronty saddle.

                                    <br>

                                    The best season to explore this trail is either winter or in the springs. During
                                    winter weather normally remains clear and panoramic beauty of the surrounding is
                                    unmatched. Adequate amount of snow is another reason that this is getting popular in
                                    recent years. In Spring the trail is bountiful with Rhododendron blossoms while the
                                    last patches of snow start melting. For you who want a longer duration camping trek
                                    may combine Ali Bugyal and Bedni Bugyal trek to complete a circuit around Lohajung.

                                    <br>

                                    Finally, it would be an unjust, if we don’t mention about our trek base Lohajung
                                    here. This small business town at an altitude of ~ 2320 m/7600 ft, comprises a one
                                    strip bazaar, few basic restaurants to eat and handful of lodges. However the views
                                    of Nanda Ghunti mountain and sunset on the southern valley side are just enough to
                                    start the beginning.

                                    <br>

                                    In winter ‘December to march’ on Brahmatal trek you not only trek to an alpine lake
                                    but also get to camp near lake. The lake water is crystal clear and a lone tree
                                    stands on the far bank. The lake got frozen in peak winter duration. The sunset from
                                    brahmatal campsite are Breathtaking and magical, everyday you will see different
                                    kind of colour contrasts in the sky and meadows. All these kind of experience make
                                    the trek life long memorable.

                                    Lower down In your first campsite you will see Bekaltal lake, bekaltal lake is
                                    covered by dense forest of oak and rhododendron. Bekaltal lake is larger than
                                    brahmatal lake. The seductive folklore of the lake dates back many centuries,

                                <h4>Brief Description About the Trek</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Welcome to the Char Dham Yatra, a sacred pilgrimage that takes you on a
                                    transformative journey through the majestic Himalayas of Uttarakhand, India. This
                                    pilgrimage holds immense significance for Hindus and attracts devotees from all
                                    corners of the globe.
                                    <br>
                                    The Char Dham Yatra encompasses four holy sites: Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and
                                    Badrinath. Each destination is nestled amidst awe-inspiring natural beauty, offering
                                    a unique spiritual experience. <br>

                                    The journey begins at Yamunotri, where devotees seek the blessings of Goddess
                                    Yamuna. Trekking through breathtaking landscapes and natural hot springs, you reach
                                    the revered Yamunotri Temple, marking the origin of the sacred Yamuna River. <br>

                                    Next, the journey takes you to Gangotri, the birthplace of the sacred River Ganges.
                                    As you traverse the scenic terrain of Uttarkashi district, you arrive at the
                                    Gangotri Temple, where devotees pay homage to Goddess Ganga. The spiritual ambiance
                                    and panoramic views of the Himalayas create an ethereal atmosphere. <br>

                                    Kedarnath, situated amidst the majestic Kedarnath range, is the next destination on
                                    the pilgrimage. The trek to Kedarnath Temple is a profound experience, as you
                                    traverse picturesque valleys and encounter the breathtaking beauty of the Garhwal
                                    Himalayas. The ancient temple dedicated to Lord Shiva fills pilgrims with a sense of
                                    divinity and devotion. <br>

                                    Finally, the journey concludes at Badrinath, the most significant site on the Char
                                    Dham Yatra. The Badrinath Temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, stands as a testament to
                                    centuries of spirituality and architectural brilliance. Surrounded by snow-capped
                                    peaks and the tranquil Alaknanda River, this sacred place offers solace and an
                                    opportunity for inner reflection. <br>

                                    Undertaking the Char Dham Yatra is not only a religious endeavor but also an

                <h6 class="text-block">
                    - There are no deluxe/luxury facilities in Kedarnath ji due to its high altitude. Only
                    dormitory-style guest houses and dharamshalas are available for accommodation.
                    <br> <br>
                    - As per the directive by the Government of India, all Indian and foreign nationals are required to
                    provide valid proof of identification upon check-in. Acceptable identification documents include
                    passports, visas (for foreigners), voter ID cards, driving licenses, and Aadhar cards. Failure to
                    provide valid ID proof may result in denial of stay.
                    <br> <br>
                    - The company is not responsible for any issues related to ID proof. Standard check-in time is
                    usually 14:00 hr, and check-out time is 11:00 hr across India. Early check-in or late check-out may
                    be available at an additional charge or based on complimentary availability. Please contact the
                    hotel directly for such requests.
                    <br> <br>
                    - If meals are included in the package, they will be served on a set menu basis, either in a buffet
                    or a fixed menu format. Any items not included in the ideal buffet/fixed menu will be charged extra
                    at the time of consumption. Hotels will decide the menu and options for the meals. Some hotels may
                    have a meal credit policy during low occupancy periods, wherein a predetermined amount is provided
                    for meals. If the bill exceeds the meal credit amount, the additional amount must be paid directly
                    to the hotel. Room service or packing of food may be charged extra at some hotels. Typically, North
                    Indian cuisine is available in Chardham, and most standard and deluxe hotels provide thali meals if
                    they are included in the package.
                    <br> <br>
                    - Breakfast is usually served from 07:00 AM to 09:00 AM, and dinner is served from 07:00 PM to 9:00

                    - In double sharing rooms, some hotels provide rollaway beds, while others offer extra mattresses.
                    If you have a preference, please inform us in advance.
                    <br> <br>
                    - AC facilities may not be available in hill areas or during stops or parked vehicle situations. AC
                    operation is restricted beyond Dehradun and Rishikesh, as hill areas typically do not have AC
                    provisions. If you require AC during the road journey in the hills, additional charges will apply
                    per day per vehicle. <br> <br>
                    - The vehicle provided will be permitted for sightseeing points mentioned in the itinerary and
                    within the city limits. Additional or off-route sightseeing may incur extra charges. Refunds are not
                    possible for missed sightseeing points. For specific excursions or sightseeing requests, please
                    contact the company directly instead of the driver. Please note that some places like
                    Trijuginarayan, Lakhamandal, Auli, Kalimath, Neelkanth Mahadev, AdiBadri, Bhavishya Badri, etc., are
                    not on the Chardham route. Kindly contact the company for including these places in the itinerary.
                    <br> <br>
                    - In case of vehicle breakdown due to technical reasons, the company will make efforts to arrange
                    another vehicle as soon as possible for major problems. For minor issues, the vehicle will be
                    repaired. Cooperation is requested in such situations.
                    <br> <br>
                    - The company shall not be held responsible for any delays, alterations in the program, or expenses
                    incurred directly or indirectly due to natural hazards, flight cancellations, accidents, transport
                    breakdowns, weather conditions, sickness, landslides, political unrest, or any other incidents
                    beyond its control. <br> <br>
                    - If the driver is uncooperative or there are any issues, please contact the company immediately.
                    <br> <br>
                    - The driver is not permitted to drive in no-entry zones or on narrow streets that may cause traffic
                    jams. The driver's working hours are usually 12 hours per day. If you require services exceeding 12
                    hours in a day, please inform us in advance.
                    <br> <br>
                    - Driving after sunset and playing music may be prohibited in some hill areas due to safety
                    concerns. Kindly cooperate with the regulations. Pick-up
                    and drop-off points will be limited to one location. For multiple pickups or drop-offs, please
                    mention it in the email conversation before booking. If multiple visits to a particular place are
                    required, please inform us in advance, as parking charges may apply.
                    <br> <br>
                    - The tour destination and route cannot be changed without prior notice. Rates are subject to change
                    based on fluctuations in diesel/petrol prices. If prices increase by more than 5% from the time of
                    booking, the rate will be adjusted accordingly. The company reserves the right to provide a similar
                    car if the originally booked car is unavailable. Some tourist destinations or hill stations have
                    restrictions on bigger tourist vehicles, including time limitations, in certain roads, shopping
                    markets, or mall roads. In such cases, guests may need to arrange alternative transportation at an
                    additional cost.
                    <br> <br>
